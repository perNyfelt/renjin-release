// N.B. In order to benefit from Gradle's configuration-on-demand, it is important
// to avoid the user of "allProjects" or "subprojects" blocks here.
// Otherwise _every_ build will trigger the configuration of _every single_ package,
// even if a small number are being built or tested.

// See: https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/multi_project_builds.html#sec:configuration_on_demand
